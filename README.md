# Linear Regression in Python for Machine Learning

## Introduction

This repository contains a practice implementation of linear regression using the Python programming language for machine learning. Linear regression is a widely used statistical method that allows us to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following software installed on your computer:

* Python 3.x
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn

## Conclusion

This repository provides a basic example of how to implement linear regression in Python for machine learning. The implementation uses scikit-learn and is relatively simple and straightforward, making it a good starting point for learning about linear regression and machine learning in general.
